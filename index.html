        <h2 id="h2d"> For as long as I can remember, sports have always played a key role in my life. Whether I am watching basketball or baseball games on television, traveling to different NFL stadiums with my dad to root on our favorite teams on their home fields, or coaching gymnastics at the gym I spent most of my childhood in, I love every single aspect about sports. My little sister and I grew up doing gymnastics together. If we weren’t at the gym practicing, we were at home playing around on the gymnastics equipment that my parents had bought us. From a very young age, I can remember wanting to be more than just a gymnast. I wanted to be a coach too, which is why often times I would help my little sister learn new skills or help her perfect her…show more content…
            They then discuss how both of the perspectives need to occur within the same individual if they want to be successful in their professional field.

            According to the three authors, “sport management practice requires creative, personalized solutions to unpredictable circumstances.” In other words, the practice of sports management requires critical thinking. Most of the classes I am currently taking are primarily taught through lectures. Critical thinking, however, is not a skill that can simply be learned by taking classes such as a few of the ones I am in now.

            In order for sports management educators to effectively help their students develop a skill that requires them to think outside of the box, they need to think outside of the box as well. Zakus, Malloy, and Edwards suggest a few different teaching methods that can be used to help future sports managers become critical thinkers. While I believe this section is directed more towards the educators of sports management, as a student I have learned valuable information about what kinds of teaching methods my future professors might use in the years to come. </h2>

        <h2 id="h2u">For as long as I can remember, I have always loved art. When I was five years old, I would mischievously color all over my sister’s bedroom walls. Now whenever I have any free time to spare, I invest it all into creating a new piece. Whether it’s rough sketches or a time-consuming finished product, my love for creating art will never change. With each new school year brought a new art class to my life. I’ve taken art every single year since kindergarten, and I have progressed with each brush stroke and eraser shaving along the way. Throughout the many years of being mentored, I quickly came to the realization I didn’t enjoy painting as much as the other mediums. Although the simple solution to a mistake is painting over it, the inability to erase my error completely has never been a concept I enjoyed. I always found myself adding excess layers of paint onto one another in order to create the perfect combination, while simultaneously creating rips in the canvas from overworking one spot. I have always favored the easier way out of art, and sticking to pencils and erasers.
            It was my sophomore year of highschool when I …show more content…
            Some I liked more than others. With every finishing detail to a project came inspiration to start a new one. I learned thousands of techniques, improving my skill level a little more each day by practicing until I didn't have any remaining free time. Most importantly, I became confident in the art I was creating. </h2>
